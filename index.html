<h1>Read More boring crap here</h1>

<p> you know, the weather is awfully nice today, i wonder what it'll be like tomorrow.</p>

<p>maybe that's why it's never nice outside, all the good days happen at the tail end of summer.</p>
<h1>Cool art by a cool fellow</h1>

<p>The image above was drawn by a good friend of mine.
Soon, theyll grow to be a better artist than me,
which is a scary thought in my mind, but thats probably my fear of being left behind speaking.
Despite whatever insecurities i have, Im very, very, proud of them.</p>

<h2>A word, before you continue.</h2>
<p>You ever wonder why you love something? Not particulary enjoy, but something more. Truly, love.
  I wish I could say that I never have wondered why, but there are many things in my life that i found worth loving. Then enjoying. Then liking.
  and surely enough, after time, growing weary of. I used to have a blazing passion over my mastery of the brush, but surely enough, found that it had dwindled into a warm ember.
  My near-unbreakable bond with my freinds was something i'd held very close to me- no, wore on my shoulder even, yet surely enough, corroded at the seams the moment they saught for love.
  The proud way i'd look at my self in the mirror stood tall would fill me with lots of glee each morning.... Though, surely enough, I... Well.. Nevermind. <p>You have no obligation to wonder why love is, or what it is, nor how. Enjoy it, because like much else in this life we share together it is ultimately fleeting. Don't let your love elude you. </p>
